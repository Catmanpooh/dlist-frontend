## D list is an implmentation of web2's craiglist

Craiglist is one of my favorite sites to use. I figured why not bring the grandfather of most sites into the web3 world and with near low transaction cost it allows for a perfect transistion. At the moment there are only for sale, community, jobs, and housing. I would like to look into bringing more services into the contract at a later time. The stack used is rust for the smart contract and nextjs with is the frontend (tried with sveltkit and failed to get it to build). 

## Check out the site

The site can viewed at https://dlist-frontend.vercel.app/ . Dummy data is deployed into the contract to check every thing is running.

## Issues

- The website needed to be refactored
- A better ux/ui expereince (pretty simple at the moment but a few small mistakes I see)
